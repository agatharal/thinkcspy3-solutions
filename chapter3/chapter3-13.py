# Create a turtle, and assign it to a variable. When you ask for its type,
# what do you get?

import turtle

foo = turtle.Turtle()

print(type(foo)) # gets the type of the foo variable
                 # i guess that it will output object type
                 # ^^ it printed <class 'turtle.Turtle'> so I'm very close haha
